# Data Preparation

The question-answering data of SEED-Bench can be downloaded on Huggingface.

The structure of the JSON file for QA data is as follows:

The image data of evaluation dimension 1-9 comes from CC3M dataset and is uploaded to the HuggingFace repo [SEED-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AILab-CVC/SEED-Bench). 
The video data of evaluation dimension 10-12 comes from Something-Something v2, Epic-kitchen 100 and Breakfast dataset.

- Evaluation Dimension 1-9
    1. Include Scene Understanding, Instance Identity, Instance Attributes, Instance Location, Instances Counting, Spatial Relation, Instance Interaction, Visual Reasoning and Text Understanding.
    2. Image data can be downloaded from our HuggingFace repo.
    3. We use the image file name of each QA pair as 'data_id'.

- Evaluation Dimension 10-Action Recognition (Something-Something v2):
    1. We use 1740 videos from Something-Something v2 validation dataset. We use the video file name as 'data_id' of each QA pair.
    2. For downloading the videos, please refer to this [link](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/ai-datasets/something-something).

- Evaluation Dimension 11-Action Prediction (Epic-kitchen 100):
    1. We use 138 long videos from Epic-kitchen validation dataset. We use the relative path of the video as 'data_id' of each QA pair. The start and end time (in seconds) of the input video segment is provided in the 'segment'.
    2. For downloading the videos, please refer to the download scripts provided in this [repo](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-download-scripts). We recommend downloading only the 138 videos required for the task 11 in the validation set, as each video is quite large.

- Evaluation Dimension 12-Procedure Understanding (Breakfast):
    1. We use videos from Breakfast dataset. We use the relative path of the video as 'data_id' of each QA pair. The start and end frame (integer) of the input video segment is provided in the 'segment' (The frame rate of each video is 15 fps).
    2. Please download videos from this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jgSoof1AatiDRpGY091qd4TEKF-BUt6I). ([The official page](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/breakfast-actions-dataset/))
    3. In our implementation, one of the videos (`P35/stereo/P35_milk_ch1.avi`) may not be decoded correctly. Using following commands with ffmpeg can fix this problem:
    ```shell
    ffmpeg -i P35/stereo/P35_milk_ch1.avi -c:v copy -c:a copy P35/stereo/P35_milk_ch1.mp4
    ffmpeg -i P35/stereo/P35_milk_ch1.mp4 P35/stereo/P35_milk_ch1.avi 
    ```

Please change the root data directory of dimension 1-12 (`cc3m_dir`, `dimension10_dir`, `dimension11_dir`, `dimension12_dir`) in [eval.py](eval.py).
