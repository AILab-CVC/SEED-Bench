 SEED-Bench consists of 19K multiple-choice questions with accurate human annotations, covering 12 evaluation dimensions
including both the spatial and temporal understanding.
## News

**[2023.7.30]** SEED-Bench is released! Data and evaluation code is available now.

## Data Preparation

You can download the data of SEED-Bench released on HuggingFace repo [SEED-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AILab-CVC/SEED-Bench).
Please refer to [DATASET.md](DATASET.md) for image and video data preparation.

## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Run Evaluation

The evaluation metric is provided in [eval.py](eval.py). We use [InstructBLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06500) as example. To run the following evaluation code, please refer to [repo](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS) for the environment preparation.

```shell
python eval.py --model instruct_blip --anno_path SEED-Bench.json --output-dir results
```

If you want to evaluate your own models, please provide the interface like [instruct_blip_interface.py](instruct_blip_interface.py).

Note that to evaluate models with multiple-choice questions, we adopt the answer ranking strategy
following GPT-3. Specifically, for each choice of a question, we compute the likelihood 
that a model generates the content of this choice given the question. 
We select the choice with the highest likelihood as model's prediction. 
Our evaluation strategy does not rely on the instruction-following capabilities 
of models to output 'A' or 'B' or 'C' or 'D'.
